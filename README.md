# Personalized Emotional Intelligence Development Platform (Vivi)

Vivi is a technology-driven Emotional Intelligence (EQ) development platform designed to help individuals build self-awareness, emotional regulation, empathy, and relationship management skills. The platform focuses on continuous emotional growth through reflection, interaction, and personalized guidance rather than one-time assessments.

## Problem Statement

Many individuals struggle to understand, manage, and express emotions effectively, leading to poor decision-making, stress, and weakened interpersonal relationships. Traditional metrics such as IQ do not fully capture life skills and emotional well-being. There is a need for an accessible, engaging, and structured system that supports long-term Emotional Intelligence development.
